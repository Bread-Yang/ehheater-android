It depends on the context, so consider the code carefully and device whether it&apos;s safe and can be suppressed or whether the code needs tbe guarded.

If you really want to use this API and don&apos;t need to support older devices just set the `minSdkVersion` in your `build.gradle` or `AndroidManifest.xml` files.
If your code is *deliberately* accessing newer APIs, and you have ensured (e.g. with conditional execution) that this code will only ever be called on a supported platform, then you can annotate your class or method with the `@TargetApi` annotation specifying the local minimum SDK to apply, such as `@TargetApi(11)`, such that this check considers 11 rather than your manifest file&apos;s minimum SDK as the required API level.

        explanation="When setting text sizes, you should normally use `sp`, or &quot;scale-independent pixels&quot;. This is like the `dp` unit, but it is also scaled by the user&apos;s font size preference. It is recommend you use this unit when specifying font sizes, so they will be adjusted for both the screen density and the user&apos;s preference.

There *are* cases where you might need to use `dp`; typically this happens when the text is in a container with a specific dp-size. This will prevent the text from spilling outside the container. Note however that this means that the user&apos;s font size settings are not respected, so consider adjusting the layout itself to be more flexible."

        explanation="When setting text sizes, you should normally use `sp`, or &quot;scale-independent pixels&quot;. This is like the `dp` unit, but it is also scaled by the user&apos;s font size preference. It is recommend you use this unit when specifying font sizes, so they will be adjusted for both the screen density and the user&apos;s preference.

There *are* cases where you might need to use `dp`; typically this happens when the text is in a container with a specific dp-size. This will prevent the text from spilling outside the container.

        explanation="When setting text sizes, you should normally use `sp`, or &quot;scale-independent pixels&quot;. This is like the `dp` unit, but it is also scaled by the user&apos;s font size preference. It is recommend you use this unit when specifying font sizes, so they will be adjusted for both the screen density and the user&apos;s preference.

There *are* cases where you might need to use `dp`; typically this happens when the text is in a container with a specific dp-size. This will prevent the text from spilling outside the container. Note however that this means that the user&apos;s font size settings are not respected, so consider adjusting the layout itself to be more flexible."

Of course it&apos;s possible that your custom drawable is translucent and you want it to be mixed with the background. However, you will get better performance if you pre-mix the background with your drawable and use that resulting image or color as a custom theme background instead.

If you want your custom background on multiple pages, then you should consider making a custom theme with your custom background and just using that theme instead of a root element background.

Of course it&apos;s possible that your custom drawable is translucent and you want it to be mixed with the background. However, you will get better performance if you pre-mix the background with your drawable and use that resulting image or color as a custom theme background instead.
